    /// Adds a user event span exporter to the tracer provider builder with the given provider name.
    ///
    /// The provider name must:
    /// - Be less than 234 characters.
    /// - Contain only ASCII letters, digits, and the underscore (`'_'`) character.
    /// - Be short, human-readable, and unique enough to avoid conflicts with other provider names.
    /// - Typically include a company name and a component name, e.g., "MyCompany_MyComponent".
    ///
    /// If an invalid provider name is provided, this method will not add the exporter to the builder.
    ///
    /// Tracepoint names are generated by combining the provider name, event
    /// level and keyword (currently hardcoded to `1`) in the following format:
    /// `ProviderName + '_' + 'L' + EventLevel + 'K' + EventKeyword`
    ///
    /// The EventLevel is always 4 (Informational) for Spans and the EventKeyword is always 1.
    /// For example, if "myprovider" is the provider name, the following tracepoint names are created:
    /// - `myprovider_L4K1`
    ///
    /// perf tool can be used to record events from the tracepoints.
    /// For example, the following will capture events from the tracepoint created above:
    /// perf record -e user_events:myprovider_L4K1
