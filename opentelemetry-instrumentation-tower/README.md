OpenTelemetry Metrics Middleware for Tower-compatible Rust HTTP servers.

## Examples

See `examples` directory in repo for runnable code and supporting config files.
Attempts are made to keep the code here synced, but it will not be perfect.

OTEL libraries in particular are sensitive to minor version changes at this point,
so the examples may only work with the OTEL crate versions pinned in `examples`.
