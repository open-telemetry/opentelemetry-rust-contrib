## Overview

This repo is intended to provide helpful libraries and standalone
OpenTelemetry-based utilities that don't fit the primary scope of the
[OpenTelemetry Rust](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust)
project.

*Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.65+][msrv]*

[msrv]: #supported-rust-versions

## Getting Started

Check individual folders for usage guidelines and examples.

## Supported Rust Versions

OpenTelemetry is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
version is 1.64. The current OpenTelemetry version is not guaranteed to build
on Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor versions
before it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable compiler
version is 1.49, the minimum supported version will not be increased past 1.46,
three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler version
is not considered a semver breaking change as long as doing so complies with
this policy.
