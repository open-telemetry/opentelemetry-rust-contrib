# OpenTelemetry Resource Detectors

Community supported Resource detectors implementations for applications instrumented with [`OpenTelemetry`].

## Overview

[`The opentelemetry-resource-detectors`] crate provides a collection of tools to detect resources from the runtime. This crate provides additional detectors for OS and process-related resources. Despite not being included in the SDK due to their lack of stability, these detectors can facilitate gathering additional telemetry information.
