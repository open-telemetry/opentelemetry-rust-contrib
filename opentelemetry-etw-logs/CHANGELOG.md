# Changelog

## vNext

- Added the `with_etw_exporter` trait method to `LoggerProviderBuilder`.
  This is now the only way to add an ETW exporter. The following line
  will add an ETW exporter using the given provider name:

  ```rust
  SdkLoggerProvider::builder().with_etw_exporter("provider-name").build();
  ```

  Event name now will be inferred from the `LogRecord` being emitted. If no name is given, it defaults to `Log`.

- Removed `opentelemetry_etw_logs::{ExporterConfig, ReentrantLogProcessor, ETWExporter}` from the public API. Ability to customize Provider Group or Keyword may be added in the future.

- Renamed `logs_level_enabled` feature to `spec_unstable_logs_enabled` to match `opentelemetry` features.

- `default` feature does not enable `spec_unstable_logs_enabled` anymore.

- Bump opentelemetry and opentelemetry_sdk versions to 0.29

- Added support for TraceId,SpanId

- Added support for populating cloud `role` and `roleInstance` from Resource's `service.name` and `service.instance.id` attributes respectively.
